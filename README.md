# spi-benchmark

This package comprises a simple tool to run the SwiftPackageIndex-Server tests in a loop, logging the run times. The purpose is to collect both information about a machine's performance as well as the tests themselves, by looking at different revisions.

Example:

```
‚ùØ swift run spi-benchmark --count 2 --work-dir ~/Projects/spi-server
[0/0] Build complete!
NB: the first iteration will also build the tests if needed, which might take a moment. This time will not be added to the test run.

Running iteration: 	0 ...
Run time: 27.126
Running iteration: 	1 ...
Run time: 26.512

Revision: 2.47.9
Run Times: 27.126, 26.512
```

## Benchmarking instructions

- Clone @SwiftPackages at revision 2.47.9 (or whatever revision was indicated for comparison)
```
git clone --branch 2.47.9 --depth 1 https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/SwiftPackageIndex-Server
```
- Make sure building and testing works by running tests
```
cd SwiftPackageIndex-Server
cp .env.testing.template .env.testing
make db-up-test
make test-fast
```
- Clone the benchmark project
```
cd ..
git clone --branch 0.0.2 https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/spi-benchmark
cd spi-benchmark
```
- Run build benchmark
```
swift run spi-benchmark -w ../SwiftPackageIndex-Server -m build --count 20
```
- Run test benchmark
```
swift run spi-benchmark -w ../SwiftPackageIndex-Server -m test --count 20
```
- Report back system spec and the last line `Run times: ...`
 
Thank you :)
